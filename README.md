# grid_painting
I'm 'painting' with CSS a water-color(?) as a project to help me learn Grid.
CSS shapes may need to come into play here as well.

### Here's the painting. It seems ideal for grid (line-based approach);

#### An outline in order to prepare definition of grids:

#### And here's step 1.

Grid columns have greek names.
& rows will have A-Z names for now (at least for the outer map).

Doesn't look like much now, but it has potential...
434px
36px
34px
12px
6px
64px
20px
28px
114px
#### And here's step 2.

Going to be harder than I thought. This is a first pass on Epsilon. CSS Shapes is going to have to come into play here. Oi vey. That box-shadow on the roof needs alpha adjustment. Or I could hide z-index/position abs a bordor-radiased circle and shadow that puppy for a rounder shadow...(?). Ugh... Why did I start this? --Now I can't stop.

I may try to change every px value to fr in order to make it responsive.

#### And here's step 3.
![step three](https://github.com/Beauvelop/grid_painting/blob/master/public/steps/step3.png?raw=true)

Need to rename elements semantically.
Need to learn "subgrid" property in CSS grid.
Need to remember that z-indexing will be done and not to render house facades as they appear on the page. z-indexed layers of linear-gradient black to opacity will do this for me.

Grid is coming easier now.
lots of counting pixels.
slicing up image sections is helping

FIXME: SASS!

Day (what? 5?) Ugh...this is slow. :(

  --BUT SO MUCH FUN!

The project is now officially subdivided and modularized is sass! :)

It was about 30minutes, but it was fun. --Totally helpful to reinforce my grasp of the behavior of sass --watch and it's vicissitudes.


#### And here's step four.

#### And here's step five.
![step five](https://github.com/Beauvelop/grid_painting/blob/master/public/steps/step5.png?raw=true)
discovering the power of linear-gradients at an angle.
Having trouble centering the entire thing.
Subdivided entire thing into modular bits.
